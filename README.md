# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate synthetic data/images that resemble a target dataset. GANs consist of two competing neural networks â€” the Generator and the Discriminator â€” trained simultaneously in a minimax game.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Built using Python and PyTorch / TensorFlow (modify as needed)
- Modular implementation of Generator and Discriminator
- Support for training on custom datasets
- Sample outputs saved at each epoch
- Optional model checkpointing

## ðŸ§  GAN Architecture

- **Generator**: Takes a random noise vector (`z`) and transforms it into a synthetic image/data sample.
- **Discriminator**: Takes a real or synthetic image and tries to classify it as real or fake.

The training process involves both networks improving together:
- Generator tries to fool the Discriminator.
- Discriminator tries not to be fooled by the Generator.
